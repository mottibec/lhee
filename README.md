# Lhee
A city autocomplete API

## Endpoint

- the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a query string parameter `q`
- the caller's location can optionally be supplied via query string parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    - each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    - each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
